I did this in collab

The way I had to see if the code worked was to look into the new csv I created using the csv reader.  It took me a couple hours of a little bit more research on exactly how to make the code do what I wanted it to for the new csv because I am ultimately using it beyond this class.  Learned somewhat the Try/Except and the timedelta portion of datetime.  Still a little over my head of exactly how these work in real time but I did learn that the try needs an except.  Also took me a minute to realize from the estimated plant date of april 1 I needed to add the timedelta I wassubtracting at first and couldn't figure out why it wasn't working the way I wanted it to.  Also found it was easier to create a blank csv to transfer the information to instead of them generating one for me.
